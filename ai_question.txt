Question/Prompt:

Incidentally, new production-grade EDI systems advertise they use AI for all this. Who knows if this is true or just marketing, but...  Could an AI really handle all this nuance and complexity given a body of source samples?  Or would it still need a structured approach like we've been building?

I'm curious just how far the AI "magic" goes before human+AI is required



AI Answer:

Great question — and one that cuts through the hype to the core of what AI can actually do versus what it claims to do.

⸻

🧠 Short Answer:

AI can absolutely help — sometimes dramatically — but not without structure. What you’re building (flattening logic, structured diffing, preprocessed mappings) is the foundation an AI needs in order to be helpful in production-grade EDI mapping.

⸻

🧰 What AI Can Do Well:

Given a good body of source samples (with ground truth targets), AI can:
	•	💡 Learn likely field mappings (LIN03 → PID05)
	•	🧩 Infer missing data sources (e.g., “this field is usually set to ‘ZZ’ if missing”)
	•	🧠 Identify patterns like “segment X usually occurs at HL[level] = T”
	•	🤖 Auto-suggest getOrElse and constant mappings
	•	✨ Generate mapping DSL stubs or configuration files (with human review)
	•	🧪 Run regression tests against known inputs/outputs

⸻

🚫 What AI Struggles With:

Without structured guidance like you’re building:
	•	❌ AI can’t reliably understand HL loop nesting and parent/child HL linkages
	•	❌ It can’t distinguish between structural presence vs semantic intent (e.g. when “Pack” is reused to mean “Tare”)
	•	❌ It will hallucinate mappings that look right but break compliance or trading partner expectations
	•	❌ It won’t produce consistent, repeatable output across mapping generations unless grounded in a spec

⸻

🤖 + 🧠 = ✅ Human + AI is the Real Magic

The best systems today combine:
	•	A structured, spec-driven, repeatable mapping engine like you’re building
	•	With AI that:
	•	Suggests field-level transformations
	•	Flags inconsistencies
	•	Proposes human-reviewable mappings
	•	Classifies sample messages to aid training/spec validation
	•	Helps bootstrap new partner integrations by aligning structure

⸻

💬 Final Take

So yes — AI can accelerate EDI mapping. But without your structured foundation (HL loop alignment, flattening, spec normalization), it’s just fancy guesswork.

What you’re doing is building the platform that makes real AI augmentation possible — and trustworthy.
